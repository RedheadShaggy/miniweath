Simple app for getting current weather in city from OpenWeatherMap.org  
  
I develop it for logging weather using my OpenWRT router which has not so much memory for other packages.  
  
Also I use Jsmn lib for parsing JSON, it's a cool and small c library.   
Check it out on http://zserge.com/jsmn.html
